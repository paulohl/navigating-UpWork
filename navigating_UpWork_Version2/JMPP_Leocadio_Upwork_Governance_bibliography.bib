  abstract  = {India has not witnessed any episode of extreme financial instability since the 1991 Balance of Payments
(BoP) crisis, largely because of its insulated banking system with 90 per cent of bank liabilities being
funded from retail depositors, sound macro-economic policies and cautious liberalisation, although spells
of volatility have been observed in Indian financial markets following 2008 global financial crisis and
2013 taper tantrum. Periods of volatility have transformed the way fiscal and monetary policies work.
Over the years, fiscal deficit reduction has freed up resources for the banking sector as the regulatory
requirements have been progressively brought down. Fiscal policy has turned accommodative during
periods of financial volatility and more recently the banking sector has been provided with capital as its
provisioning requirements have increased after declaration of NPAs. In case of monetary policy, India
formally adopted inflation targeting with price stability as the primary objective in 2016, after
witnessing periods of high inflation. However, following the significant global volatility in recent
times and the collapse of an NBFC behemoth in September 2019, the Indian central bank is now
increasingly focused on maintaining financial stability. One such evidence was implicit when the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) refrained from raising interest rates in October 2018 policy to defend the
Rupee against an overwhelming market consensus. In fact, RBI explicitly emphasized that the central
bank was largely tolerant with the domestic exchange rate finding its market determined level and was
concerned only to the extent that exchange rate depreciation feeds into headline inflation. The recent
decline in growth numbers has further reinforced this consideration. In this article, we have focused on
the banking sector and more recently NBFC sector, while outlining the recent policy changes which have
been introduced to support the objective of financial stability.},

We identify four major themes in the literature on platform work and the underlying metaphors associated with each. Platforms are seen as entrepreneurial incubators, digital cages, accelerants of precarity, and chameleons adapting to their environments. Each of these devices has limitations, which leads us to introduce an alternative image of platforms: as permissive potentates that externalize responsibility and control over economic transactions while still exercising concentrated power. As a consequence, platforms represent a distinct type of governance mechanism, different from markets, hierarchies, or networks, and therefore pose a unique set of problems for regulators, workers, and their competitors in the conventional economy. Reflecting the instability of the platform structure, struggles over regulatory regimes are dynamic and difficult to predict, but they are sure to gain in prominence as the platform economy grows.},

From taxi drivers to pizza deliverers to the unemployed, we are all aware of the huge changes that it is driving in our lives as workers, consumers, and citizens. This is the first comprehensive overview of this highly topical subject. Drawing upon years of research, stories from gig workers, and a review of the key trends and debates, Jamie Woodcock and Mark Graham shed light on how the gig economy came to be, how it works and what it's like to work in it. THey show that, although it has facilitated innovative new services and created jobs for millions, it is not without cost. It allows businesses and govenments to generate value while passing significant risk and responsibility onto the workers that make it possible. This is not, however, an argument for turning back the clock. Instead, the authors outline four strategies that can produce a fairer platform economy that works for everyone."

Such work consists of the remote provision of a wide variety of digital services mediated by online labour platforms. Focusing on workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the article draws on semi-structured interviews in six countries ( N = 107) and a cross-regional survey ( N = 679) to detail the manner in which remote gig work is shaped by platform-based algorithmic control. Despite varying country contexts and types of work, we show that algorithmic control is central to the operation of online labour platforms. Algorithmic management techniques tend to offer workers high levels of flexibility, autonomy, task variety and complexity. However, these mechanisms of control can also result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation and exhaustion.</p>},

This article reviews the extent of this type of work in Australia, and its main characteristics. It then considers the applicability of existing employment regulations to these 'gig' jobs, citing both Australian and international legislation and case law. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of traditional regulations, minimum standards and remedies in the realm of irregular digitally mediated work. Regulators and policymakers should consider how to strengthen and expand the regulatory framework governing gig work. The article notes five major options in this regard: enforcement of existing laws; clarifying or expanding the definition of 'employment’; creating a new category of ‘independent worker’; creating rights for ‘workers’ rather than employees; and reconsidering the concept of an ‘employer'. We review the pros and cons of these approaches and urge regulators to be creative and ambitious in better protecting workers' minimum standards and conditions in these situations.},

Yet the scale and scope of these changes is hard to assess, because conventional labour market statistics and economic indicators are ill-suited to measuring this "online gig work”. We present the Online Labour Index (OLI), an experimental economic indicator that approximates the conventional labour market statistic of new open vacancies. It measures the utilization of online labour across countries and occupations by tracking the number of projects and tasks posted on major online gig platforms in near-real time. The purpose of this article is to introduce the OLI and to describe its methodology. We also demonstrate how it can be used to address previously unanswered questions about the online gig economy. To benefit policymakers, labour market researchers, and the general public, our results are published in an interactive online visualisation which is updated daily.},
